# National Pokédex

386 English species names are bundled in National Pokédex order from PokeAPI:
https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi/blob/master/data/v2/csv/pokemon_species_names.csv

Generation ranges: Kanto 001–151; Johto 152–251; Hoenn 252–386.

The original hidden-name treatment follows Emerald's numbered, dashed-name convention. Its list rendering calls CreateMonName(0, …) for unseen entries, producing ten dashes, and omits the caught marker:
https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/src/pokedex.c

We adapt registration to successful saved scans, using a labeled checkmark instead of a caught Poké Ball. All 386 slots remain browsable. Unscanned names remain hidden, including search and accessibility. Tracked cards open the newest saved scan. Duplicate scans count once, sample entries do not count, and later-generation scans remain persisted without changing completion. Progress derives from the existing persisted history, so previous scans register automatically.


## Sprite cards

All 386 front-facing Pokémon Emerald sprites (64 × 64 PNG) are bundled for offline use from:
https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites/tree/master/sprites/pokemon/versions/generation-iii/emerald

Pokémon and Pokémon character names are trademarks of Nintendo. Sprite artwork belongs to its respective owners, including Nintendo, Game Freak, and The Pokémon Company.

At the user’s request, the adaptive card grid displays unscanned sprites as solid black alpha-mask silhouettes on a pale green screen. Tracked entries use the latest persisted background-removed scan image. Nearest-neighbor interpolation preserves the Game Boy Advance pixel art. This silhouette treatment is an intentional adaptation rather than an exact Emerald screen reproduction.

Sprites are registered as named image sets in Assets.xcassets so SwiftUI image lookup resolves compiled assets reliably. Each 64 × 64 sprite is declared at 1× scale.

The standalone Scan history section has been removed. Saved scan data remains persisted and tracked cards still open the latest scan.


## Persisted scan images

ScanImageStore writes each successful cutout as an atomic PNG to Documents/Scans/<entry UUID>.png, retaining alpha transparency. The entry's imageName is stored with the existing persisted history. The directory and filenames are unchanged, so previous scans remain compatible. Both the full entry and the Pokédex cards load from this shared store after relaunch. Cards asynchronously downsample to 320 pixels instead of decoding every original at full size. A missing or damaged file displays “Image unavailable” without discarding tracked progress.


## Bundled Pokédex data (dhl84 fork)

`App/PokemonData.swift` holds name, genus, types, entry text, generation, height and weight for every species, 001–1025, and the journal and picker list them all. Sprites are the default front sprite of each species from PokeAPI/sprites (96 × 96), one image set per number. It is generated from the PokeAPI CSV files `pokemon_species_names.csv`, `pokemon_types.csv`, `types.csv` and `pokemon_species_flavor_text.csv` (English, language 9). The entry text prefers FireRed, then LeafGreen, Emerald, Sapphire and Ruby. Game Boy Advance all-caps words are title-cased and species names restored to their normal spelling.
